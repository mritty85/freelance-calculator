- `sheets/BudgetProfiles.md` - Budget profiles table schema with JSON columns
- `sheets/RateProfiles.md` - Rate profiles table schema
- `sheets/Config.md` - Configuration data schema

**Deployment Infrastructure:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment
- Deployed to: https://mritty85.github.io/freelance-calculator/
- Google Apps Script deployed as Web App (public access)

### Changed
- Updated form validation to save data before validating (fixed step 1 error)
- Removed Content-Type header from API calls to avoid CORS preflight
- Added null checks to all toggle functions (prevent JavaScript errors)
- Updated README with MVP user ID approach documentation

### Fixed
- Step 1 validation error ("Please select your location and filing status")
  - Fixed field name mismatch: `filing-status` vs `filingStatus`
  - Fixed validation order: save form data BEFORE validating
- CORS error blocking API calls from GitHub Pages
  - Removed `Content-Type: application/json` header (triggers preflight)
  - Used `redirect: follow` mode instead of `mode: cors`
- JavaScript null reference errors on Step 3
  - Added null checks for missing form elements
  - Gracefully handle missing checkboxes

### Technical Decisions
1. **No Users table in MVP** - Anonymous users with browser-generated UUIDs
   - Zero friction for validation testing
   - Privacy-friendly (no personal data collected)
   - Can add email collection in Phase 2
2. **Hybrid architecture** - GAS backend + GitHub Pages frontend
   - Fast deployment (~1 hour)
   - Zero hosting costs
   - Scales to 10,000+ users
3. **JSON columns in Sheets** - Store complex nested data
   - Avoids 50+ columns per table
   - Query on top-level fields, details in JSON
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, expand if needed
   - Simplified expenses (3 categories) by default
   - "Want to get more precise?" reveals detailed breakdown
5. **Smart defaults** - Location and service-based suggestions
   - Pre-fill suggestions reduce form friction
   - User can always override

### Database Structure
**BudgetProfiles Sheet** (auto-created):
- budgetProfileId: `budget_x1y2z3w4`
- userId: `user_27e2cc21-359f-4...` (browser-generated UUID)
- personalExpensesJSON: Complete expense breakdown
- overheadJSON: Business overhead details
- cashFlowJSON: Buffer calculations
- taxesJSON: Tax breakdown with all deductions
- summaryJSON: Final budget summary

### Testing Results
‚úÖ Complete budget flow works end-to-end:
1. User fills 4-step form
2. API calculates budget with accurate taxes
3. Results display comprehensive breakdown
4. Data saves to BudgetProfiles sheet
5. Draft state persists across sessions

**Test Case:**
- Location: California (Single)
- Service: Web Development
- Expenses: $4,000 essential + $800 debt + $700 lifestyle = $5,500/month
- Overhead: $600 health insurance, 10% retirement, $500 business expenses
- Result: ~$135,000-$140,000 gross income needed
- Data successfully saved to Google Sheets ‚úÖ

### Notes
- **Deployment time:** Approximately 6 hours from zero to fully working app
- **Lines of code:** 11,079 insertions across 32 files
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/mritty85/freelance-calculator
- **Live site:** https://mritty85.github.io/freelance-calculator/
- **GAS deployment:** Public Web App with "Anyone" access
- **Key insight:** CORS with GAS requires avoiding custom headers in fetch()
- **MVP is LIVE and functional** - Ready for testing with real users

### What's Working
‚úÖ Multi-step form with validation
‚úÖ Smart defaults and progressive disclosure
‚úÖ Accurate 2025 tax calculations (federal, state, SE tax)
‚úÖ Iterative gross income calculation
‚úÖ Complete budget breakdown display
‚úÖ Data persistence to Google Sheets
‚úÖ Draft save/resume functionality
‚úÖ Mobile responsive design
‚úÖ Error handling and loading states

### What's Next
- Build Rate Calculator page (convert budget ‚Üí hourly rate)
- Test with 3-5 freelancers
- Fix any bugs or UX issues
- Prepare for paid validation ($49 √ó 10 users)

## Decision Log

**Important decisions and their rationale:**

### 2025-10-26: Google Apps Script for MVP
- **Decision:** Use Google Apps Script instead of Next.js/Python
- **Rationale:** Founder has experience, zero hosting costs, fast prototyping (2-4 weeks to MVP)
- **Trade-off:** May need to migrate later if GAS limitations become blocking

### 2025-10-26: Validate Before Building
- **Decision:** Manual concierge MVP with 10 customers before writing any code
- **Rationale:** Avoid building the wrong thing, validate willingness to pay, understand what users value most
- **Success criteria:** 8+ say "worth it", 6+ would pay $29/month, 5+ raise rates

### 2025-10-26: No Integrations in Phase 1
- **Decision:** No FreshBooks, QuickBooks, or CRM integrations initially
- **Rationale:** Reduces complexity, faster to ship, keeps focus on core value (calculations + market data + scripts)
- **Future:** Can add integrations in Phase 2+ if validated
