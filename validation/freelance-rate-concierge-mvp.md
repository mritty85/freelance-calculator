# Freelance Rate Calculator - Concierge MVP Script

## Week 1-2: Manual Validation (Zero Code)

### The Offer Script

**Subject: Are you undercharging? I'll analyze your freelance rate for $49**

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Quick question: Do you know if you're leaving money on the table with your current freelance rates?

Most freelancers I talk to have no idea if they're charging the right amount. They either:
- Guessed based on what "felt right"
- Copied someone else's rates
- Let a client dictate the price

And they're almost always undercharging by $10k-30k per year.

I'm testing a new freelance rate analysis service and need 10 beta testers. Here's what you get for $49:

**✅ True Cost Analysis**
- Your actual tax burden (income + self-employment + state)
- Benefits you're self-funding (insurance, retirement, PTO)
- Hidden costs most freelancers miss
- Real billable hours calculation (not fantasy math)

**✅ Market Intelligence Report**
- What freelancers with your skills actually charge
- Industry-specific data for your niche
- Rate ranges by experience level
- Where you fall in the market

**✅ Negotiation Playbook**
- Scripts for your next 3 client conversations
- How to handle "your rate is too high" objections
- When to walk away calculator
- Red flag detector for bad clients

**✅ 30-Minute Consultation**
- Review your analysis together
- Answer questions
- Role-play a negotiation if helpful

**Normal price will be $199, but first 10 people get it for $49.**

Interested? Hit reply and I'll send you a quick intake form.

P.S. - If you're thinking "I'll just use a free calculator online," fair enough. But those calculators get the tax math wrong, have no market data, and don't help you actually raise your rates. This does all three.

**Your Rate Negotiation Playbook**

**Your New Rate: $[X]/hour** (or $[Y] project minimum)

**Existing Clients - Raising Rates:**

Subject: Rate Adjustment for 2025

"Hi [Client],

I wanted to give you advance notice that my rates will be adjusting to $[X]/hour starting [date]. This reflects my growing expertise in [specific value you bring] and ensures I can continue delivering the high-quality work you've come to expect.

I'm giving you 60 days' notice so we can plan accordingly. I truly value our partnership and want to make this transition smooth.

If you'd like to discuss project-based pricing or a retainer arrangement, I'm happy to explore options that work for both of us.

Thanks for your continued trust in my work.

[Your Name]"

**New Clients - Stating Your Rate:**

"My rate is $[X]/hour for [type of work]. That's based on my [Y years] of experience and the results I deliver - like [specific example].

For this project, I estimate [Z] hours, so we're looking at approximately $[total].

I can send over a detailed proposal with milestones and deliverables. When would you like to move forward?"

**Handling "That's Too High":**

Client: "That's higher than we budgeted."

You: "I understand. Let's talk about scope. Here are a few options:
1. We could phase the project - start with [Phase 1] for $[X], then expand if it's a good fit
2. I could recommend [junior resource] who charges $[lower rate] but may need more direction
3. We could adjust deliverables from [full scope] to [reduced scope] to fit your budget

What works best for your situation?"

**When to Walk Away:**

🚩 Walk away if:
- Client wants "trial period" at 50%+ discount
- Client won't commit to payment terms in writing
- Client asks for spec work before hiring
- Rate would net you less than $[minimum acceptable wage]/hour after taxes

✅ Consider if:
- Client is reputable with good payment history
- Project offers portfolio value or strategic relationship
- Slight rate reduction but guaranteed volume

**Your Walk-Away Number: $[X]/hour minimum**
(Below this, you're earning less than $[Y]k/year equivalent)

**Red Flag Detector:**

Watch for these warning signs:
- "We're a startup, but we'll pay more later" = 🚩 Never happens
- "This will be great exposure" = 🚩 Exposure doesn't pay bills
- "Just need this done quickly" = ✅ Charge rush fee (+25-50%)
- "We have a long-term need" = ✅ Explore retainer pricing
- "Budget is absolutely fixed" = 🟡 Usually negotiable, try adjusting scope

**For [Their Specific Situation You Asked About]:**

[Custom advice for the scenario they described in the intake form]

"In your case, I'd recommend:
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific script]
3. [Specific counteroffer]

If they push back, you could [alternative approach]."

## Success Metrics

After delivering to 10 freelancers, measure:

**Validation Metrics:**
- ✅ **8+ of 10 say "this was worth way more than $49"** = Proceed to build
- ✅ **6+ of 10 say they would pay $29/month for quarterly updates** = Subscription model viable
- ✅ **5+ of 10 actually raise their rates within 30 days** = Real behavior change

**Cost to Validate:**
- Your time: ~10 hours total (1 hour per person)
- Money spent: $0 (just your time)
- Revenue generated: $490 (10 × $49)

**If validation fails** (less than 8/10 say it was worth it):

## Key Questions to Ask During Feedback Calls

1. **"On a scale of 1-10, how valuable was this analysis?"** (Need 8+ average)

2. **"What surprised you most?"** (Reveals the "aha moment" - usually tax burden or market comparison)

3. **"What would you change or add?"** (Builds your product roadmap)

4. **"Would you pay $29/month for this tool if it:**
   - Automatically updated quarterly with new market rates
   - Let you compare client offers instantly
   - Gave you negotiation scripts for each situation
   - Tracked your rate increases over time"

5. **"Would you recommend this to other freelancers? Why or why not?"**

6. **"What's the #1 thing holding you back from raising your rates right now?"** (Reveals the REAL barrier - often confidence, not knowledge)

---

## Red Flags That Mean Stop

If you hear these repeatedly, the problem may not be severe enough:

- "This is interesting, but I'm fine with my current rate"
- "I already knew most of this"
- "I don't think clients will pay more"
- "The market rate data doesn't matter in my niche"

If 5+ of 10 say these things, the pain point isn't acute enough to build a business around.

---

## Green Lights That Mean Build

If you hear these repeatedly, you've found product-market fit:

- "Holy shit, I'm leaving $20k on the table"
- "I had no idea my tax burden was this high"
- "I'm raising my rates with my next 3 clients"
- "Can I pay you to do this for my freelancer friends?"
- "When will this be available as a tool?"
- "I would pay $50/month for this, easy"

If 8+ of 10 say these things, start building immediately.

## What You'll Learn

This concierge MVP teaches you:

1. **What freelancers value most** (usually market data > tax math > negotiation scripts, but you'll see)
2. **What they'll actually pay for** (valuable ≠ willingness to pay, you need both)
3. **What's hard to deliver manually** (identifies automation opportunities)
4. **What objections come up** (client pushback, market skepticism, etc.)
5. **What questions you can't answer** (reveals knowledge gaps to fill)

**Most importantly:** You learn if this is a vitamin (nice-to-have) or painkiller (must-have).

Only build if it's a painkiller.
